1.  Adjust the naming scheme to make more sense

2.  Organize/structure code better (such as separate file for setup, easier to modify down the line), adjust gameplay loop to be more easier to read
and moving aspects out into different functions (single responsibility)

3.  Following from second point, needs better application of software design principles
